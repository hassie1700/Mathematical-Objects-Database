\section{INTRODUCTION}
A Mathematical Objects Database can be like a museum with all of best mathematical specimens is an intricate catalog and the connections between them. SageMath is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the General Public Licence. It builds on top of many existing open-source packages like matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R and many more accessing a combined power through a common Python based language.

\section{BACKGROUND ABOUT THE PROBLEM}

\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
Due to an increased large-scale cloud computing which is one of the ways to
provide sophisticated web interfaces that allow both experts and amateur to
easily navigate their contents, there is a problem of uncharted mathematical
terrain which requires online resources that provides detailed maps for
mathematics. This can be solved by building mathematical objects databases
using segmath for charting the terrain of rich, new mathematical worlds, and
sharing of discoveries of the best mathematicians over the web.
